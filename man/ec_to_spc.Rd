\title{
Function to convert electrical conductivity to specific conductance
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Electrical conductivity is the measured conductivity of a sample. Specific conductance is a standardized measure representing what that conductivity *would have been* had it been taken at 25C. The function is described in Standard methods for examination of water and wastewater in section 2510 B under number 5 (19th edition)
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
ec_to_spc(temp, ec)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{temp}{
  temperature at which the sample was taken, degrees Celsius
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{ec}{
  conductivity of the sample, should be in units of uS/cm (micro Siemens per centimeter)
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
